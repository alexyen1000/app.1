This application displays the information from the Couchbase phonehome server, plotting vertical lines on a globe to see the information based on location.  It runs using [Cesium](http://cesiumjs.org/), which is a Javascript library for creating 3D globes and maps in a browser by using WebGL.  

The default settings show the number of times a unique cluster givin its location, version, and other factors had been accessed by customers.  Note that the scale between lines are not linear as to keep the spectrum of line size within practical limits.
